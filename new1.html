			<h2>Project</h2>
			<h4>Green Power System & Analytics</h4>
			<p>The objective of this project was to build a front as a web-based and end as an oracle database.
			Each group was provided with smartplugs and modems that can measure the power consumption of appliances that are connected.
			The data was collected as .csv file in excel. With SQL developer, our group imported all the data into SQL server and used it for making PL/SQL Server Page.
			This project was sponsored by a software startup company called Constellation Energy.
			<br />(website is unavailable because we used the private server and the database was expired after the semester)</p>
		
			<h4>Ingredient Chef</h4>
			<p>
			This project was the first web project I did in my life. We have a group of five and had to build a website that allows users to search
			for the food recipes based on the ingredients they already have. Each of us had to do one usecase and had to use JavaScript and Ajax somewhere in each of our usecases.
			For our team, we had usecases of rating system, comment system, user login function, and my usecase was searching by ingredients and
			filter function by certain characteristics. To be honest, the outlook of the website looks bad because we didn't really tried to look good
			since the grades were based on the functionality. So, our group tried hard to make things work.
			(this website is available, but most of the features do not work because the database was expired.)
